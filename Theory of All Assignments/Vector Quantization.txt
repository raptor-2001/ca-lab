The code starts by importing the necessary libraries and creating a function to create an image.
 The code then creates an image with dimensions of w x h x d, which is the size of the original image.
 Next, it creates a label index for each pixel in the new image that corresponds to its position on the original image.
 It then loops through all pixels in both images and stores their corresponding values in a list called varL.
 Finally, it returns this newly created array as an output variable named "image".
 The next line imports KMeans from sklearn library and uses it to fit six clusters into our data set using random initialization method (random_state=1).
 After fitting our data set, we can use predict() function to find out what cluster each sample belongs to.
 The code attempts to show the outcome of reducing an image by a factor of 255.
 The code above has two parts: 1) The original image (bird.gif) and 2) A reduced image that is reduced by a factor of 255 (reduced_image).
