The code starts by declaring a vector of vectors, lower and upper.
 The size of the vector is set to row.
 Then it loops through each element in the matrix arr, which is a vector of integers, and creates two new vectors: one for the lower triangular part of the matrix and one for the upper triangular part.
 The code then iterates through each element in both matrices (upper[i][k] = arr[i][k] - sum; lower[i][k] = arr[i][k] + sum) until all elements have been processed.
 The code is an example of a matrix decomposition algorithm.
 It takes in a vector> array, arr and returns the lower triangular matrix luDecomposition(arr, v) and the upper triangular matrix uDecomposition(arr, v).
 The first for loop iterates over each row of the input array arr.
 The second for loop iterates over each column of the input array arr.
 The third for loop iterates over each element in the input array arr.
 The code starts by declaring the variables.
 int lower[][] = new int[n]; // Declaring a 2D array of integers to store the lower triangular matrix.
 int upper[][] = new int[n]; // Declaring a 2D array of integers to store the upper triangular matrix.
 The code then sets up an if statement that will check for each row in A and B, and assign 1 or 0 depending on whether it is equal to k or not.
 If it is not equal, then sum all elements in column j from A with element j from B (arr[k][j]).
 This value will be stored in variable "sum".
 Then divide this value by number of elements in column i from A (upper [i]) and multiply it by number of elements in column i from B (lower [i]).
 The result will be assigned back into arr[] at position k. Finally, set lower[] at position k with this value divided by upper[] at position i:
 The code will produce the following matrix: A = LU B = LUX
 The code is a loop that iterates through the array arr.
 It starts from the last row and goes to the first row.
 For each iteration, it calculates the sum of all elements in lower[i] and upper[i].
 Then it divides this sum by y[i], which is calculated using an equation.
 The code then creates two vectors x and y, where x contains values for every element in upper[] while y contains values for every element in lower[]
 The code does the following: 1.
 It creates a vector of size arr.size() which is filled with 0's for all the elements in the array lower.
 2.
 It iterates through each element in lower and calculates its sum using a nested loop, where it multiplies every element in row by y[j] and sums up the result to get sum.
 3.
 The value of x[i] is calculated as follows: x[i] = float((y[i] - sum)/upper[i][i]);
