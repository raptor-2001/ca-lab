The code calculates the mean and standard deviation of a set of numbers.
 The code calculates the sum, average, difference, and standard deviation for each number in an array.
 The code uses a loop to iterate through all the numbers in an array.
 The code computes the sum of the squares of each column and the mean.
 The difference between these two values is then computed by subtracting one from the other.
 Finally, a standard deviation is computed by squaring this difference and dividing it by 100.
 The code above does not compute an MSE (Mean Squared Error) because it assumes that there are 99 observations in total, which would be true if we were to use a sample size of 1,000 or more.
 The code starts by declaring a variable called "TOTALsum" and a variable called "TOTALmean".
 The code then calculates the difference between these two variables.
 This is done by subtracting the mean from each of the five sets of data.
 The code then calculates the standard deviation for this set of data.
 It does so by calculating the square root of (the difference divided by 99).
 The code will calculate the total standard deviation of a given set of numbers, and then use that value to calculate the mean.
 The code will calculate the total standard deviation of a given set of numbers, and then use that value to calculate the mean.
