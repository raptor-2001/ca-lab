The code starts by importing the necessary libraries.
 The cv2 library is used to import images, resize them, and show them on a computer screen.
 The numpy library is used for matrix operations such as adding 1 to all values in an array.
 Matplotlib is used for plotting graphs of data that has been imported from the image file kitchenGray .
 The code starts by declaring variables that will be needed later in the program: H , which will store histograms of 256 different colors; s , which stores shape information about each pixel; x , which stores a single color value from the original image; y , which stores an empty list of 255 numbers representing pixels with no color assigned yet; equal , which holds another histogram created using the same process as before but with different starting points (the first point being 0); and cv2 .
 This last variable is declared at the end because it's only needed when running this program.
 Next, we create two functions called Hist() and equal() .
 These are both helper functions that help us do some calculations related to creating histograms.
 Then we use these functions to create our own histogram based off of our original image kitchenGray .
 We then plot this new graph on top of
 The code attempts to make a binary image of the original image, which has been resized and converted to grayscale.
 The code then makes a histogram of the new image, before plotting it on top of the original image.
