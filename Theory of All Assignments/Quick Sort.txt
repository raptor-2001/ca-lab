The code is a program that asks the user to enter how many numbers they want to enter.
 The code then creates an array of integers and starts looping through each number in the array, adding it to another integer variable called j.
 After this is done, the code quick sorts all of the numbers from 0-j into two arrays: arr[0] and arr[1].
 Then it loops through these two arrays again, printing out each number on screen.
 The first thing you should notice about this program is that there are three main functions: partition(), quickSort(), and main().
 These three functions are used for different purposes but they all have one thing in common: They use variables called i and j which represent indexes or positions within an array.
 In order to understand what's going on with these functions we need to look at their implementations more closely.
 Partition() takes an int[] as input (arr) and divides it into two parts based on its index value (i).
 It does so by creating a new int[] with just one element (pivot), dividing arr into l=l
 The code attempts to sort an array of integers.
